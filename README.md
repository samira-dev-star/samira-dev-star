# 👋 Hi, I'm Samira Mashtizadeh  

🎯 Full-Stack Web Developer | 🎨 3D Designer | 🌍 Multilingual Self-Taught Learner  

I’m a self-taught **full-stack developer** and **3D artist**, passionate about blending technology, creativity, and languages.  
My journey has been shaped by curiosity and dedication — from teaching myself programming and design, to mastering multiple languages including **English (IELTS 7, with 7.5 in Speaking & Listening)**, **German**, and **Arabic**.  

## ✨ Highlights
- 💻 Strong experience with **Django**, **FastAPI**, and building APIs  
- 🌐 Knowledge of **JavaScript**, **jQuery**, **SQL**, and modern web technologies  
- 🏥 Delivered real-world freelance projects (including a full **clinic website**)  
- 🎓 Multiple **Harvard CS50 certifications** (Python, Web, SQL, Scratch, etc.)  
- 🎨 Skilled in **3D design with Blender** — modeling, rendering, and animation  
- 🌍 Multilingual: English, German, and Arabic  
- 🤝 Eager to collaborate with experienced developers and contribute to global projects  

## 🚀 My Vision
To create projects that are not only **technically advanced** but also **aesthetically engaging**.  
I believe in continuous learning, open collaboration, and combining different skills — from web development to 3D design — to deliver impactful solutions.  

> Here on GitHub, you’ll find both my **coding projects** and my **3D design works**, reflecting my passion for innovation, creativity, and growth.
